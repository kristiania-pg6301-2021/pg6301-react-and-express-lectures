  "description": "The purpose of web sockets is to enable responsive communication between the client and the server; especially for messages sent by the server. Websockets are established over HTTP, just like normal requests, but they keep the socket open for either party (client or server) to send arbitrary messages. In many cases, these messages are sent as JSON objects.",
